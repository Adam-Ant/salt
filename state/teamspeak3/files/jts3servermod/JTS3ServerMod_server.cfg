# That function name you choose is important and has to be unique. It will be used as prefix for the configuration key names and chat commands.
# Don't use spaces in the function names, only use letters, numbers, minus and underscore!
# Most functions allow multiple usage, that allows you to set as many welcome messages or idle check rules, as you want.
# Don't forget that you have to put all settings of the functions in this file.
# Hint: Start the bot with the argument -updateconfig after adding bot functions, that writes the configuration for all functions into this file!
# Whole command: java -jar JTS3ServerMod.jar -updateconfig
# Notice: This -updateconfig will also delete all lines of removed or renamed functions in this config file!
# For more information about the functions read documents/ConfigHelp.html or documents/ConfigHelp_deutsch.html!
# Example: IdleCheck:idle,IdleCheck:idle_guest,MuteMover:mute,WelcomeMessage:welcome,WelcomeMessage:welcome_guest
# This example gives you the following:
# - Two IdleCheck with the name idle and idle_guest
# - One MuteMover with the name mute
# - Two WelcomeMessage with the name welcome and welcome_guest
#
# Function list (use only once!):
# AutoMove - Move connecting clients of a specified server group to a specified channel
# LastSeen - Chat command to check the last online time of a client (client database list cache must be enabled!)
#
# Function list (multiple use possible):
# Advertising - Send messages to channel or server chat every X minutes
# AwayMover - Move the client as soon as away status is set for longer than X seconds
# BadChannelNameCheck - Checking for bad channel names, can delete the channel and punish the client
# BadNicknameCheck - Checking for bad nicknames and can punish the client
# ChannelNotify - Notify specified server groups about clients joining a specified channel
# IdleCheck - Move or kick an idle client, can also send an idle warning message
# InactiveChannelCheck - Delete channels if empty for more than X hours
# MuteMover - Move the client as soon as the specified mute status is set for longer than X seconds
# RecordCheck - Move or kick a recording client (of course only the record function of the Teamspeak client is detected)
# ServerGroupNotify - Notify specified server groups about clients of specified server groups connecting to the TS3 server
# ServerGroupProtection - Make sure that only specified clients are members of the specified server groups
# WelcomeMessage - Sends a message to new connected clients
